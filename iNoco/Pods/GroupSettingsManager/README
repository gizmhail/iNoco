GroupSettingsManager will easily save settings in both local settings and group settings, to simplify usage between an app and its extensions

In each target Info.plist, fill a GSMGroupId key, containing your group name string ("group.<...>").
Then, use [GroupSettingsManager sharedInstance] as you would use [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults], your keys will be saved in NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults and in the NSUserDefaults with your group name as its suite name. 

The lib includes some logging tools, to help debugging key lifecycle between an app and its extension.
